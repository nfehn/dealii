New: The step-69 tutorial program presents a first-order accurate
<i>guaranteed maximum wavespeed method</i> based on a first-order <i>graph
viscosity</i> for solving Euler's equations of gas dynamics. It introduces
and discusses number of interesting programming techniques: hybrid
parallelization (MPI + task based thread parallelization); the use of
non-distributed deal.II matrices in an MPI parallel context with index
rewriting; offline data preprocessing; background-thread offloading for
output; and checkpointing/restore.
