New: Introduce a new communication-pattern class Utilities::MPI::NoncontiguousPartitioner. 
It is similar to Utilities::MPI::Partitioner, however, does not make any
restrictions regarding to the ordering of the underlying index sets. This class enables
efficient repartitioning of vectors, which might be benefitial in interfacing with 
external libraries that expect a certain fixed order (like checkerboard partitioning).
